### About 

This repository is just a small collection of personal solutions to the coding tasks on https://adventofcode.com/.
 
### Repository Structure

An example puzzle solution directory is given in the subfolder 0. 
In general there will be a folder for each day. If you want to add a solution just create a folder in the respective day, give that folder a descriptive name ( containing the language and techniques you used for the puzzle) and add your files to that folder.

You can also add a README.md file to the folder and summarize how your solution works. 
If the building and running your program isn't obvious, this would also be a good place to give instructions on how to run your program.
